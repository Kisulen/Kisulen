### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Maria Ustyuzhanina and this is my Quality Assurance Engineer portfolio. I'm currently open for hire if you are looking for a motivated, self-reliant, challenge-driven QA engineer who does excellent performance both as a team player and solo. 

### My stack 
Manual testing: Web and API testing, Postman, Jira, DevTools, Git.
Automated testing: Java, JUnit5, TestNG, Docker, Selenium, Selenide, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Faker. CI/CD: GitHub, Appveyor. 

### My projects
Here you will find my projects for Testing Automation, code review and Java projects. 
AutomationDiploma is the repository with my automation testing project, where I did both manual and automated testing on the tour purchasing page. The bugs found are listed in the Issues section. In the execution of this project I implemented JUnit, Selenide, Faker, DBUtils, MySQL, Docker along with PageObject approach and Allure reporting tool. 
JavaqaTeamDiploma was a teamwork project aimed at whitebox testing of a "game", where me and my teammate reviewed the original Java code, reported bugs using Issues on GitHub, then swapped the branches and fixed the reported bugs.
